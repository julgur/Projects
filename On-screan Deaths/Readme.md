# Course project for Introduction to Machine Learning and Data Mining. 

Jun2019.

The project is based on the dataset of movies, containing counts of on-screan deaths. The analysis of the data may reveal how the ratings depend on the number of deaths, how this number relates to the release year and so on. Moreover, genre and length of the film combined with on-screen violence may provide information on age ratings. This is a good set for the classification and clustering problems. This analysis may be the first step to the automatization of age rating systems. Moreover it may be helpful in the development of recommendation systems.
